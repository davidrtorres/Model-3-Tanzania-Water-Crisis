## Introduction:
The Tanzania Ministry of Water is seeking to solve the ongoing water crisis in Tanzania by increasing the number of functioning water wells.  It is crucial to the health and 
safety of communities that its residents have access to safe drinking water.  Tanzania has a lot of water wells that are non-functioningor in need of repair. 

## Task:
The Tanzanian Water Ministry is seeking to solve the water crisis in Tanzania by increasing the number of functioning wells.  Predictive models can be used to aid in solving this
problem.  The objective is to build classification models which will predict the functionality of the water wells in Tanzania.  I will concentrate on the models' accuracy in predicting whether the wells are functioning.  These predictions will provide the Tanzania Minstry of Water with information regarding the overall status of the wells.  These predictions will also provide important information regarding whether features such as funders and waters impact the functionality of the wells.
